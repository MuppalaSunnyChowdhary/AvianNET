# AvianNET: Intelligent Bird Species Identification and Diversity Monitoring System

**Author:** Sunny Chowdhary, Muppala  
**Supervised by:** Dr. Howard Hamilton

## Abstract
The global decline in bird populations underscores the need for innovative monitoring methods. AvianNET aims to identify bird species through sound, building on the success of BirdNET and using advanced audio analysis and machine learning. Employing CNNs and MFCCs, the project seeks to accurately determine bird species from a large sound database, addressing challenges in sound data variability.

**Keywords:** bird sound recognition, biodiversity monitoring, CNN, MFCC, audio analysis, deep learning.

## Introduction
This project develops a model to recognize bird sounds, inspired by BirdNET, using audio analysis and machine learning to identify bird species accurately. It leverages CNNs for feature extraction from audio inputs, utilizing MFCCs to enhance classification of bird calls.

## Background Work
Drawing insights from "Cognizance of the Action of Humans by Applying Enhanced Techniques," the project focuses on feature extraction and the application of CNNs for accurate bird sound recognition, emphasizing the importance of data preparation and model training.

## Methodology
The project will use CNNs to analyze spectrograms of bird calls, with data sourced from the Xeno-canto database. Preprocessing steps include noise reduction, segmentation, and normalization to prepare the data for training.

## Schedule
Key milestones include project ideation by January 19, 2024, data collection by February 10, initial model development by March 1, with further testing, improvements, and final presentation by the end of April 2024.
